ASSOCIATION RULE LEARNING APRIORI ALGORITHM

People who bought also bought, people who liked also liked...

Apriori is designed to operate on a database containing transactions.  For exaplem, collections of items purchased by by customers per transaction, or details of website visits frequency.

Apriori uses a bottom up approach, where frequent subsets are extended one item at a time, a step known as **candidate generation** and groups of candidates are tested against the data.
